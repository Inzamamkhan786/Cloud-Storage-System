# 🚀 Cloud Storage System

A **Full Stack Cloud Storage System** inspired by **AWS S3 / Google Drive** that allows users to securely upload, manage, and monitor files with **usage-based billing**, **user authentication**, and **storage management**.

---

# 📌 Project Overview

This project simulates a **Cloud Object Storage System** where users can:

* Upload files
* Download files
* Delete files
* Track storage usage
* Monitor billing
* Manage user profile
* Authenticate securely

The system is designed to mimic **real-world cloud storage architecture** like **AWS S3 / Google Cloud Storage**.
